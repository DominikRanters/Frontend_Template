chaynsÂ® React with Hooks & Redux Toolkit example
===================
1. Install all project dependencies with  `npm i`
2. Start your webpack-dev-server for debugging your project with `npm start`
    > The webpack-dev-server is now running on your localhost on the port 8080. If the port is not available you can change it in the dev.babel.js in the webpack folder. 

    > `npm start` runs the server in HTTPS mode. You need to add a ssl certificate to `/webpack/ssl`. If you just need HTTP then you can use `npm run start:http`
